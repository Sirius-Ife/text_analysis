## Methodology

The NLP analysis was conducted using the following steps:

1. **Data Collection:**  
   Survey responses were collected for the Pallet Market Survey Report for Q1.

2. **Text Preprocessing:**

4. **Sentiment Classification:**  
   The extracted keywords were categorized into sentiment classes (positive, negative, uncertainty, and litigious) based on their context and usage.

5. **Analysis and Reporting:**  
   The frequency and proportion of each sentiment category were calculated and analyzed to provide insights into the overall market sentiment.

## Results
